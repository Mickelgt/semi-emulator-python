# semi-emulator-python

A beginner-friendly yet technically challenging emulator for the classic CHIP-8 virtual machine, written in Python. This project simulates a full CHIP-8 system â€” including its memory, instruction set, display, and input â€” and is capable of running original CHIP-8 games like Pong and Tetris.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Build a functioning emulator from scratch
- Gain deep understanding of low-level computing concepts such as:
  - Memory management
  - Opcode decoding and CPU cycles
  - Input handling and graphics rendering
- Write clean, modular, and well-documented Python code
- Test the emulator using real CHIP-8 ROMs

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features (Planned)

- âœ… Full implementation of the CHIP-8 instruction set
- âœ… 64Ã—32 monochrome display using `pygame`
- âœ… Hex-based keypad input
- âœ… Debugging tools (step-through execution, memory inspector)
- âœ… Modular design for easy future extension
- ðŸŽ® Build a custom CHIP-8 game (e.g., a Tetris clone) once the emulator is complete

## ðŸ“š Background

CHIP-8 is a simple, interpreted programming language used in the 1970s to run games on systems like the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800. Despite its age, it provides a perfect entry point for anyone looking to explore systems programming, emulation, or low-level CPU design in software.

This emulator project is designed as a summer learning experience and technical portfolio piece, focused on both **functionality** and **code quality**.
